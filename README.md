# Fraud Detection using Linear Regression

This repository contains a Python implementation of a machine learning model using linear regression to detect fraud in transactions over a network. The model is trained on a dataset of transactions, and can be used to predict whether a given transaction is fraudulent or not.

# Dependencies

Python 3.x
NumPy
pandas
scikit-learn
Usage

## To use the model, follow these steps:

Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/shubham-attri/fraud-detection.git
Navigate to the repository directory: cd fraud-detection
Install the dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the script: python fraud_detection.py
Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset of transactions that includes features such as the amount of the transaction, the time of the transaction, and the location of the transaction. The dataset also includes a label indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent or not. 

# Evaluation

The model is evaluated using standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
